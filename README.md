# Music Platform

Welcome to the Music Platform project, a dynamic web application designed for music enthusiasts. Built with React, Vite, and powered by a Strapi backend, my platform offers a rich user experience, enabling users to explore, listen to, and download songs based on their roles and permissions.

## Features

- **Advanced Search & Filters**: Easily find music that suits your taste with our advanced search options and filters.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Download permissions are finely controlled, with specific roles having the ability to download songs.
- **Pagination**: Browse through songs efficiently with our pagination system, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A running instance of Strapi (for the backend)

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/music-platform.git
    cd music-platform
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - Using npm:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    - Using yarn:
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```

3. **Configure the environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables. At a minimum, you need to specify your Strapi backend URL:
    ```plaintext

    ```

4. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or, if you're using yarn:
    yarn dev
    ```
    Now, your application should be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
